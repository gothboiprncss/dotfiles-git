*__Note: You will find the apple cursor I use on the [apple_cursor](https://github.com/ful1e5/apple_cursor) github page.__*

*__Note: If you wish to use my pacman config you should check it beforehand and see if it fits your needs.__*

I'm also adding a wallpaper that I use.
    
## Important!

_1. This config is made for an **Nvidia GPU** since I have RTX 4070 TI. If you want it to fit for something else you'll have to delete **Nvidia specific env variables form hyprland.conf.**_

_2. **I'm not the original creator of [everoforest](https://github.com/3rfaan/arch-everforest)** template and config files. I just tuned already existing .dotfiles to my own preference._
